Twitter Sentiment Analyzer
- Developed a desktop application which can be used to get the user insights on some specific interest for some specific location on the basis of live tweets
- Implemented algorithm which classifies and counts votes for text using Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naïve Bayes, Bernoulli Naïve Bayes and Linear Support Vector Machine and finally classifies the text after counting the total votes
- Trained algorithm using training data of around 10,000 tweets
- Classifying tweets in two classes : Positive & Negative, saves the result and generates sentiment in the form of graph
- Used Python as a primary language, Tkinter for UI and used text files to save all the data
